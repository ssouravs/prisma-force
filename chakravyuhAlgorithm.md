Inputs and declarations:
enemy:-> An array representing the powers of enemies in each circle.
power:-> Abhimanyu's initial power.
a:-> The number of times Abhimanyu can skip fighting an enemy.
b:-> The number of times Abhimanyu can recharge himself with power.

Algorithm: 
Initialize the index, i to 0.
While loop: Iterate through each circle of enemy line:
If I is equal to 3 or 7(as it is in the 4th and 8th level respectively), update the power of the enemy in that circle to regenerate itself once with half of its initial power of the previous levels(K3 and K7 namely) as it can attack from behind.
Check if Abhimanyu's power is greater than or equal to the power of the enemy in the current circle:
If true, reduce Abhimanyu's power by the enemy's power and move to the next circle (i++).
If false:
If Abhimanyu has remaining skips (a > 0), use one skip and move to the next circle (a-- and i++).
Otherwise, if Abhimanyu has remaining power recharges (b > 0), recharge his power by b and use one recharge (power += b and b--).
If both skips and recharges are exhausted, return false as Abhimanyu cannot defeat the current enemy.
Return true if Abhimanyu successfully crosses all circles without exhausting his power and skips/recharges.
